The reason this is failing is because (Python 3) input returns a string. To convert it to an integer, use int(some_string). 
You do not typically keep track of indices manually in Python. A better way to implement such a function would be 
def cat_n_times(s, n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(s) 

text = input("What would you like the computer to repeat back to you: ")
num = int(input("How many times: ")) # Convert to an int immediately.

cat_n_times(text, num)

You cannot assign a String to an int - how would you do so? A String can be anything from \"some text\" to \"   a   5   0 \". How would you convert the first and/or the second one to an int?\nWhat you probably wanted is:\nSystem.out.println(\"Enter number => \");\nresponse = reader.nextInt();\n// notice this        ^^^\n\ninstead of:\nSystem.out.println(\"Enter number => \");\nresponse = reader.nextLine();\n",

Change,\npublic static int TimeConvert(int num)\n\nto\npublic static String TimeConvert(int num)\n\nAlso, you should follow Java naming conventions. Methods start with a lower class letter, your method looks like a class. Finally, I'd put the verb first. Like,\npublic static String convertTime(int num)\n\nFinally, if you can use Java built-in functions, I",

To convert it to an integer, use int(some_string). \nYou do not typically keep track of indices manually in Python.

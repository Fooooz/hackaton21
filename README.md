# Purpose

When working i find it very common to copy/paste appearing errors to stackoverflow.com. To work smarter and save some time we automize that process saving many minutes of our work daily.

# Requirements

- Python3.x (tested on Python3.7.7)

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

python main.py {desired command}

for testing in our project works commands like

python main.py python ProgramExample/error.py

python main.py javac ProgramExample/HelloWorld.java

# Current functionality

Our application now captures errors from compiling programs, passed them to analize location of errors, sends request for best answer and for each error provide view in browser to beggining of answers and link to stackoverflow.com

# Future plans

Test application with other programing languages, build application to work without external python libraries
